### The ISFP on a Team
ISFPs are sensitive, helpful team members who look for opportunities to contribute in an immediate, practical way. They want to assist other people and provide support, and often take on the role of listener. Oriented to cooperation, the ISFP will look for ways to compromise and accommodate others. They tend to step in when others need help and are often prepared with specific, relevant data that can help the team understand the facts of the situation.

ISFPs are at their best when they can work with others in a supportive, action-oriented role. They excel at creatively solving problems to meet people’s immediate needs. ISFPs shy away from theory and future projections, and may become impatient with ideas that have no concrete benefit for people. ISFPs are characteristically unassuming, and may be reluctant to advocate strongly for their own perspective on a team. They can become frustrated with team members who are domineering or competitive, and do best on a caring, egalitarian team where everyone’s contribution is appreciated.


### The ISFP as a Leader
In leadership positions, ISFPs are driven by a personal mission and interested in helping their teams cooperate to accomplish realistic goals. Their strengths lie in understanding the needs and concerns of the people they work with and adapting gracefully to changing circumstances. ISFP leaders are practical and down-to-earth, good at sizing up resources and assessing the requirements of the current situation. They are good at building trust and leading by example, preferring to be quietly supportive rather than authoritarian or domineering.

ISFPs often prefer not to be in a leadership role, but are sometimes motivated to take the lead when the project is personally significant to them. When they do lead, they do best heading a small, cooperative team to achieve practical and tangible results.
