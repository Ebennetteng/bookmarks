I spend a lot of time on internet, losing myself in lot of topics. I choose GitHub to list my findings and bookmarks in a central location for productivity, to avoid losing my findings, and also to share them with the world. I'm also on Twitter at [@MorganGeek](https://twitter.com/MorganGeek)

No, instead, it talks about cooperation.
