* Good code needs motivation, shitty code just needs time.
* Choosing a language because it has cheaper developers is like building your house with Lego so you can hire anyone as a construction worker.
* I cannot fix that bug... I'm busy writing a new one.
* CI is a practice, not a tool, and requires discipline from the development team.
* Red is the new green
* Do it, with <insert the name of a CI/CD tool here>, there is no try
* It doesn't matter who you are, only what you will become
